2. The server will run on a specified port (40000 - 65535) of any machines

dnsserver.py
1. This provides basic DNS Server function with the purpose of return client optimal IP
Mechanism/Measurement: DNS look up is based on both passive measurment by measuring geographical location 
and active measurement by measuring DNS <-> replica server RTT(Round-Trip-Time);
