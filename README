Team: gusong
Members: Chen Gu, Jiahao Song
Chen's work mainly focused on building a working DNS server, he uses DNS redirection to send clients to the replica
server with the fastest response time.
Jiahao's work mainly focused on building a HTTP server with cache management that returns content requested by clients
========================================================================================================================
httpserver.py
1. This supports basic HTTP GET request for client to fetch web pages.
2. The server will run on a specified port (40000 - 65535) of any machines
Caching Mechanism: Similar to LRU(Least Recently Used cache) Algorithm, leaning towards LCU(Least Commonly Used). Remove
the record with the least hit count. Pseudo code posted:
            if file exists in cache:
                respond client with the file
            elif file doesn't exist in cache:
                fetch specific file on original server
                respond client with that file

dnsserver.py
1. This provides basic DNS Server function with the purpose of return client optimal IP
(finding the fastest replica IP is implemented based on geo-location).
2. We implemented DNS protocol with UDP, the process is listed below:
             1. Receive UDP packet from Client
             2. Unpack the packet
             3. Select best replica based on geo-location
             4. Pack the header, question, and
             5. Pack answer section with best replica ip
             6. Send the response to client

We use http://ip-api.com/ API to fetch geo info of a particular IP)
We calculated the location of the server based on the latitude and longitude provided by the api above
========================================================================================================================
We faced the challenge of not having clear instructions on how to pack and unpack DNS packet. We spent a lot of time
packing the answer section but still have minor bugs.
We faced the challenge of implementing a working cache management on httpserver using Json decoding and encoding;
We looked up plenty of information to find the best way to calculate the geo-location.
